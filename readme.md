# TimeMoney

This is a web application that allows users to calculate the time value of money (TVM), a fundamental concept in financial mathematics. The concept states that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future. TVM is based on the idea that money can earn interest or be invested over time, and thus has a potential future value. This application allows users to perform complex financial calculations such as how to calculate the present value or future value with ease.
